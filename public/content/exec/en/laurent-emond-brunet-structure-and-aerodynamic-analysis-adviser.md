I give recommendations to the team on the technical aspect of the work based on my experience, and I help certain members to develop certain skills specific to aircraft design. This is my 4th year on the team. What I like the most is the feeling of attachment between all the members, regardless of experience, year and skills. We are all dependent on each other and it seriously gives a family atmosphere. In fact, I'm still coming to meetings and taking part in the project this year after 3 full years just to see the members and enjoy the warm atmosphere of the team.
