It takes more than just passion for airplanes to fly. Behind every engineering marvel, there was a tedious process of testing, calibrating, and manufacturing. My job is to transform ideas from paper into physical objects. In the early stages of the designing process, my team and I work with other departments to implement new manufacturing techniques while keeping the aircraft easily manufacturable. At the end of the project, I have the task of managing the supply chain and coordinating the assembly process. I am a third year aerospace student. I love what we are doing and itâ€™s a privilege to be working with those amazing people.
