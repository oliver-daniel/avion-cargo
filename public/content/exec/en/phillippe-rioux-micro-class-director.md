So you registered yourself in an engineering program but you want to go above and beyond the books and theoretical subjects presented in classes? Here’s a little secret: getting involved in technical student associations is one of the most rewarding experiences for a curious and motivated student. That’s it! My role in Avion Cargo is to integrate all the students who are interested to be a part of the team, primarily first year students. In short, the SAE competition is divided into three categories and the Polytechnique Montréal team participates in both the regular and the micro categories. We believe that the micro class presents a great project to undertake and allows for the development of skill sets and team bonding in a short amount of time. I personally really appreciated my experience and I’m here to make sure that you can say the same!
