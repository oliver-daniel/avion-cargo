I’m responsible for ensuring that all the components of the airplanes made by Avion Cargo will be able to resist the efforts they will endure while flying and landing. I analyse and determine different materialistic constraints imposed on the airplanes to ensure they will function properly. A second important responsibility of the department is to plan and execute the resistance tests on the various pieces and materials used by the team. I’m in my second year of aerospace engineering at Polytechnique Montréal and it is also my second year with Avion Cargo. This student association pushes us to surpass our limits of what we think we’re capable of and to always learn more about an amazing subject: aeronautics.
