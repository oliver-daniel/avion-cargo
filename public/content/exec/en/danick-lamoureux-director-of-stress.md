I am responsible for all simulations and numerical analyzes of Avion Cargo, both in fluid dynamics and in solid mechanics. I am in my third year at Avion Cargo and it is always so pleasant to be part of this stimulating team. My favorite aspect of Avion Cargo is the members learning along the way, we start the project not knowing what to expect and we get by when we run into problems.
