As director of design, I coordinate the team that will design and CAD the airplane. Our objective is to collect data from the other departments and use them to decide on the various components of the airplane. The integration work allows us to bring to life all the ideas that the team has in the form of a 3-dimensional drawing. Iâ€™m in my third year with Avion Cargo and it's an adventure filled with memories where we learn as much about aeronautics as we do about ourselves.
