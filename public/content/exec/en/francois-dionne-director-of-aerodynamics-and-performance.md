In the aerodynamics and performances group, the ultimate goal is to ensure a stable flight and a maximum score at competition. Starting with the airfoil, then the optimisation of the payload and the stability analyses, our department provides all the necessary dimensions so that the department of design can do their job. I’m in my third year with Avion Cargo and every year is a new challenge. Join us to have a super great year in our company!
