I make sure to integrate all students into the team, mainly first-year students, who are interested in participating in the project. The micro class, dedicated to new students, is a great engineering project that allows you to learn concretely and to be part of a dynamic team. I am a second year student in aerospace engineering and I am in my second year in Avion Cargo. As I greatly appreciated my experience in this team, my role is also to shape yours in your image.
