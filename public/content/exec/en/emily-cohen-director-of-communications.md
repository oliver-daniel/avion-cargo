I manage all of the external communication of the association, from collaborating with other student associations within the Polytechnique community to updating our wonderful sponsors of our progress. I’m a second year student in aerospace engineering and this is my second year with Avion Cargo. My favourite aspect of our association is the amazing attitude that everyone has; I’ve never had so much fun learning.
