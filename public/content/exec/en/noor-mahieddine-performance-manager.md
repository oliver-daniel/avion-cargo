I take care of maximizing the performance of our aircraft according to the rules of the competition by first working on our Python optimization program, then by doing analyzes for our various aerodynamic choices. This is my second year on the team and my first as a member of Regular, before I was manager of the Micro team. What I like about Avion Cargo is, first of all, that we are a small team, so we can quickly become friends, which makes working on the project much more fun!
