My role is first and foremost to assure that the team can function smoothly towards our common goals. I have tasks that are both technical and administrative and I am constantly adapting to the needs of my team. Iâ€™m in my third year of aerospace engineering at Poly and even after three years, I never cease to be in awe of the complexity of a project like Avion Cargos', especially when the teamwork is properly structured and we can accomplish more.
