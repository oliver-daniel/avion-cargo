My primary responsibility is managing the team’s portfolio. Firstly, I must ensure that we have the necessary budget for the project, that the expenses for the year do not surpass a certain amount and I must verify the transactions. The second important role is to look out for sponsorships. Our project would not be possible without our wonderful sponsors supporting us, which is why searching for financing is so vital. This year is my 3rd with Avion Cargo and the team is my second family. Everyone is ready to work hard and I love the amazing collaboration and creativity of our members that bring us to building our airplanes.
