I am a third-year student at Polytechnique, and it will be my second year in Avion Cargo. This year, I am the director of the performance department, meaning I will be evaluating the performances of our aircraft to assure we are competitive. The thing I like the most about Avion-Cargo is seeing everyone evolve threw the year. Engineering projects make you learn a lot and develop yourself, seeing this in every one of the members and helping them reach their potential is fulfilling.
