> ***Mission statement:*** We are a close-knit team of engineering students utilizing our problem-solving skills to become the leaders and engineers of tomorrow through practical engineering challenges from competing annually at SAE’s Aero Design competitions. 

***History:*** 
Founded in 1996, Avion Cargo brings together students who are passionate about aviation, engineering, aerodynamics and the unique challenges posed by aircraft design. We have been competing in the regular class of SAE’s Aero Design competition since our founding year and in the micro class since 2011. With deep-rooted values of teamwork, collaboration and learning above all, we pride ourselves on not only being competitive, but creating a legacy of alumni who are knowledgeable problem solvers and excellent collaborators. We create an environment geared towards extracurricular learning and enhancing the university experience. Our greatest pride is being part of a team that is a tight-knit unit and a family away from home. The experiences created here at Avion Cargo - from the design process to competition - are the toolboxes used throughout the rest of our careers as engineers and as students of the world.
