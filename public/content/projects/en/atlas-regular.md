With a modified challenge for 2011, the team put their best foot forward with their creativity with an optimised design to meet the new rules. The limit of the sum of the dimensions was 225 inches, a takeoff in less than 200 feet and the challenge to lift the heaviest payload possible, the team performed several trade studies for the best solution. The monoplan was the final decision with several original characteristics. Whitcomb winglets and a mechanism in the empennage that allows a rotation to have access to the cargo bay are two examples. The team, led by Anthony Rode, finished 3rd in design and 6th overall.
