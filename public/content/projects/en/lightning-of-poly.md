The year 2020-2021 for the micro class has been a big change, as new rules have been released for the competition. The mandate: to transport a maximum of cardboard boxes and metal plates while taking off over a distance of 8 feet and minimizing flight time. Our team had to completely redesign the aircraft to meet these new constraints. Much larger than previous planes, Lightning of Poly has a 48-inch wingspan and has an open fuselage carrying two large 12-inch x 12-inch boxes and over 0.67 lbs of metal plate. Even though we couldn't make it to the competition this year, the team, led by Noor Mahieddine, were able to secure a place on the podium in 3rd place in the oral presentation and finished 5th in the technical report. We also got to see the fruits of our labor watching our plane take off at the flight demonstration.
