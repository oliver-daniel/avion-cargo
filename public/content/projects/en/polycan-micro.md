The 2017 micro class challenge was multifaceted and entailed several design constraints. Not only did the aircraft have to be disassembled and stored with its payload in a container of limited diameter, the cargo bay had a minimum size imposed and the payload must weigh less than 10 pounds. Polycan was a monoplane high-wing with an empty weight of 1.35 pounds and had a maximum payload of 3.16 pounds. The team, led by Dominic Dufour, finished 14th in design, 9th in technical presentation, 2nd for most payload liften, 8th for payload ratio and 12th overall.
