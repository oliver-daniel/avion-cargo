The new challenge for the regular class brings with it a new type of cargo. Tennis balls, representing passengers and steel plates representing their baggage with a ratio of baggage/passenger to be respected were introduced as the new style of cargo. As well, there were certain standards of positioning to be respected. The Journey lifted 25 tennis balls and 0.5 pounds of “baggage” per tennis ball. The team, led by Dominic Dufour, finished 16th in design, 7th in technical presentation, 11th for most payload lifted and 13th overall.
