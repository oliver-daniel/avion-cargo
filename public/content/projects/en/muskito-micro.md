This year’s micro class was the third year of the PVC tube challenge. The challenges of the project included:
Maximizing the weight of PVC tubes lifted,
Assembly in less than three minutes,
Both cargo and aircraft must fit inside a cardboard box with strict inner and outer dimensions.
Our 2019-2020 team brought lots of creativity and ambition to the table and settled on a flying wing configuration as the final design. The configuration entails a blended fuselage and no tail, making stability all the greater a challenge. Equally so, the wings were made of carbon fiber composite, a first in the association’s history. 
The team, led by Alexis Basset and Emily Cohen, had some good flights and spectacular crashes, finishing 13th in technical report and marketing presentation, 15th in flight performance and 13th overall.
