The third year of the 2014 challenge, the Northern Wind is the optimised version of its predecessors, Skyron and Aeolus. A monoplane high-wing, with its H-shaped empennage, the Northern Wind has improved aerodynamics with considerably reduced drag, thanks to the teamâ€™s research and hard work. With Laura Sab Leblanc as team captain, Northern Wind had a maximum payload of 26.6 pounds.
