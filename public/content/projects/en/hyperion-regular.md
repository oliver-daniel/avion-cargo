The challenge of the regular class this year entailed not only restrictions on materials but also dimension constraints. With no plastic composites permitted, the aircraft is intended to lift the maximum cargo all while respecting the dimensions limit. The sum of the length, height and width could not surpass 200 inches, and the cargo bay had an imposed minimum size of 5x5x10 inches. Hyperion succeeded in meeting these requirements and more. A biplane made of wood and aluminum, it lifted up to 11 pounds of cargo. The team, led by Anthony Rode, won first place in the regular class for most payload lifted and overall.
